# Easy-Cook
Hi, there! This is my second cool team project! This is a cooking app where we used recipe-API, data storage, some dependencies, and many others! Thank's to my teammates for perfect job!
Notice. If you have a problem with the recipe loading, I recommend to create a feee account on https://spoonacular.com/food-api
